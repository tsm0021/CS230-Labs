# CS230L1
Trey McAtee CS 230 Lab 1
Requirements for the first lab.

You need to make a master folder to store all of your work for the site to your personal, PUBLIC GitHub repo to push your content. If your repo is not public, I cannot see it.

The HTML file below will be used as a basic About page for your website. We will push the master folder with all of its contents to GitHub after we are finished and copy and paste the link to the repository in the comments. Every individual must submit this

index.html
  Must contain: 
    10 modified CSS attributes in-line or as a CSS file. Only two per element count (e.g. you can't just modify 10 attributes in the same element, so you need to modify at least 5     elements)
    Two buttons
    Four photos
    One title
    One heading element (h1, h2, or h3)
    One or more buttons.
    One <p> element describing you or your fictional team for your site. 2 - 3 sentences is adequate. If you go with the team, you can make up life stories or experience your         characters have in their field.
Folder named images with 5 photos of your choosing.
Github link to your public repo.
Completed survey under the Survey content area.
