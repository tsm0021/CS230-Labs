            About the Site Creator
            <p>
                My name is Trey McAtee. I am completely new to HTML, so I apoligize outright for possible spaghetti code. Outside of that, I will most likely choose to make 
                this site into a review site and hope to learn alot from this course. Also, in my visual studio, which I am also completely new too, the h1 and a few other elements for this code is
                highlighted red. It still seems to work though, so at least for the scope of this lab I guessed it wouldn't be an issue. Also, my button doesn't do anything,
                but I guessed that too wouldn't be an issue as the requirement was just to have one. 
            </p>
